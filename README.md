Hey, I'm Marlin. I've been here for a while, but I feel like I'm just getting started. I won't go into much detail about myself or what I'm working on just yet,
but I hope to put this site to good use in the future. A few things about my background below.

Education: BS in CS (University of Delaware)
Professional Experience: Software Engineer for government entity (6 years as of 1/2021)
Tech:
- html
- css
- javascript
- java
- react
- linux

Current Focus: Learning React to broaden my web dev skills. It's the first of many things that I want to delve into. 

More to come later.
